2025 was a year of reckoning for me. In many respects I arrived at the painful realization of how much I do not know and the magnitude of the unknown unknowns further away. Then I realize a simple fact: I have been climbing a sort of [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect){:target="_blank"} super-curve.

Above is a simple illustration of the curve. Stage 1 and 2 are marked red because they are characterized by passion and a proclivity to overextend. Stage 2 is the peak of stupidity. Stage 3 and 4 are marked blue because they are characterized by low spirits and the "unwinding of positions" in identity, social relations, financial even. Stage 4 marks the bottom of the valley of despair. Stage 5 and onward marks the grounded growth in confidence.

Here are some of the factors that can slow down or prevent a person from moving past stage 1-4. The underlying ideas are (1) the confidence in stage 1 & 2 is sort of a fake, unreliable kind (2) confidence must drop for one to grow competence during stage 3 & 4.

- Downside risk
    - Promises made to other people - families, friends, colleagues, shareholders, contractual partners - based on past or present level of confidence.
    - Self-identity and reputation based on past or present level of confidence.
    - Financial obligations that rely on non-deterioration in factors above to fulfill.
    - Health conditions that rely on non-deterioration in factors above to manage.
- Weakness in the physical fundamental. Mental resilience is needed to move along the curve and is heavily influenced by physical health and strength.
- Responsibility avoidance in the mindset or culture.
